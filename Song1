Together we can go to rehearsal.
Even if it's going bad, we are going to make it work! 
We're going to start together and we're going to end together. 
One for all and all for one.
Now let's have a conversation.

Now we are doing good together. 
We all look over there why did they have to put that there. 
Well, maybe they had to put it there because I don't know dance shoes. 
and.... LOOK!!!

For what reason is there a sock in the kitchen sink! 
She is sitting over there and I am a little bit slow but she super fast when running races.

I'm standing right here. 
Hey did you wash your hands today? 
You'd better wash your hands. 
I want to go wash my hands now and now I am washing my hands. 
Oh and don't forget to wash the floor today. 

My shirt is yellow.
You have cool eyes. 
Mine are blue,
what color are your eyes?
I like to part things.
You know like hair, I like to cut things too also like hair, and I'm tall!
